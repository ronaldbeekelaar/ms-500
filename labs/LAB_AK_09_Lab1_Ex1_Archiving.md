# Module 9 - Lab 1 - Exercise 1 - Initialize Compliance 

In your role as Holly Dickson, Adatum’s Security Administrator, you have Microsoft 365 deployed in a virtualized lab environment. As you proceed with your Microsoft 365 pilot project, your next steps are to implement archiving and retention at Adatum.  

### Task 1 – Activate In-Place Archiving

In this next phase of your Adatum pilot project, you will access the Security & Compliance Center to activate Holly Dickson’s archive mailbox.   

1. In **Microsoft Edge**, select a new tab and enter the following URL in the address bar: **https://protection.office.com**. This opens the Office 365 Security & Compliance Center.  You should be logged in as Holly Dickson.

2. In the **Security &amp; Compliance Center**, in the left navigation pane, select **Information Governance** and then under it, select **Archive**.

3. On the **Archive** window, note that the archive mailboxes for all users other than Holly Dickson are enabled. These archive mailboxes were enabled when the VMs were built for this training course and these users were preconfigured in the tenant. However, since you added Holly in an earlier lab, her archive mailbox is disabled by default.

4. To enable Holly’s archive mailbox, select **Holly Dickson** in the user list. 

5. In the details pane on the right, Holly’s archive mailbox is currently listed as disabled. Select **Enable**, and then in the **Warning** message that appears, select **Yes** to confirm this action.

6. In your Microsoft Edge browser, leave the Office 365 Security & Compliance Center tab open as you will use it in a later task in this lab.
