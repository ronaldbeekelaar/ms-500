1.  Click **Billing Administrator** and add Patti Fernandez back into the **Billing Administrators** role.


1.  Open an **In Private** browsing session and navigate to **https://portal.azure.com** and login as **Patti** using her UPN. example PattiF@YourTenantHere.onmicrosoft.com with the password given by your lab hoster (hint: the password is likely the same as the MOD Administrator password).

By default, roles do not require approval unless configured explicitly in settings. 

 If the role does not require approval, it is activated and added to the list of active roles. If you want to use the role right away, follow the steps in the next section.

 If the role requires approval to activate, a notification will appear in the upper right corner of your browser informing you the request is pending approval.


### Task 2: Use a role immediately after activation


When you activate a role in PIM, it can take up to 10 minutes before you can access the desired administrative portal or perform functions within a specific administrative workload. To force an update of your permissions, use the **Application access** page as described in the following steps.


1.  Click **Sign Out**.

1.  Log back in as Patti in the inPrivate browsing session.


### Task 3: View the status of your requests


You can view the status of your pending requests to activate.


1.  Still signed in as **Patti**, in the Azure Portal, click **All services** and search for and select **Azure AD Privileged Identity Management**.

1.  Click **Azure AD Roles**.

1.  Click **Pending requests** to see a list of your requests.


### Task 4: Deactivate a role


Once a role has been activated, it automatically deactivates when its time limit (eligible duration) is reached.

If you complete your administrator tasks early, you can also deactivate a role manually in Azure AD Privileged Identity Management.



1.  Still signed in as **Patti**, open Azure AD Privileged Identity Management.

1.  Click **Azure AD roles**.

1.  Click **My roles**.

1.  Find the role you're done using and then click **Deactivate**.
